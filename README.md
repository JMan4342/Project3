## **User Story**

- As the planner for a camping trip, I want to have access to an application that will help me plan a trip to a national park.
- WHEN I review the application's home page, THEN I am presented with a search option where I can search for a national park by name or location, an option to login to a personal account or create an account, and a navigation bar with options to view camping, hiking, biking, supplies.
- WHEN I click on the login page, THEN I will be routed to a login page where I can login using a unique username and password.
- WHEN I click on the login page and I do not have an account, THEN I can select an option to create an account.
- WHEN I select a national park from a returned search, THEN I am presented with that park's detailed page.
- WHEN I am presented with a national park's detailed page, THEN I am presented with the park's contact information that include the park's name, address, and phone number.
