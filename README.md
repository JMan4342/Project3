## **User Story**

- As the planner for a camping trip, I want to have access to an application that will help me plan a trip to a national park.
- WHEN I open the app, THEN I am presented with the option to login to my account.
- WHEN I do not have an account to immediatelly log into, THEN I can select a link to register for a new account. 
- WHEN I successfully log into my personal account, THEN I am taken to my personal dashboard, also named Basecamp, where I will view any saved national parks, activites, and campgrounds that I saved from my search queries.
- WHEN I select the "Parks", "Activities", or "Camping" links in the navigation bar, THEN I am presented with a search form where I can search for a national park, activities offered at national parks, and campgrounds on their respective pages based on keywords.
- WHEN I am presented with the search results, THEN when I select a national park, activity, or campground that is generated from the search results I am directed to a detail page about the selected.
- WHEN I am presented with the detailed page, THEN I am able to view the name, description, and photo of the selected option.
- WHEN I am presented with the search results, THEN I am able to save the item to my Basecamp.
- WHEN I am visit my Basecamp, THEN I am able to view my saved search results.
